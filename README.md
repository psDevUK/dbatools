## Welcome
This is my newest blog page that I have setup in honour of the mighty dbatools PowerShell module. Look it goes without saying that the last few years for everyone has been pretty miserable, and just as things seem to be getting better with Covid, a new more horrifying tradgedy is unfolding with Ukraine and Russia. I just hope you are keeping safe whilst reading this new blog

### What is dbatools?
It is a super awesome PowerShell module that is basically SQL Server Management Console (SSMS) in the comfort of your own terminal window. It has lots of super cool functions that can make your life a lot less clicky by not having to remote onto the server, not having to open up SSMS and login to it, not having to navigate and click here and click there...It's just solid PowerShell functions that get the job done

### Tell Me More
It's awesome what more do you need? Okay if you don't believe me how rock solid this module is check the [official site](https://dbatools.io/) out.

### Credit where credit is due
I personally bought the meap copy of the [offical book](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-dbatools-in-a-month-of-lunches). This book I can personally recommend and I believe if you like the blog site or it's useful then buy yourself a copy of the book. Thank you.
